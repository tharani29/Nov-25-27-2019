### Stage 1

* Create a component that loads the following countries and cities on load.
* India, US, UK
* You can use the following cities for convenience.

```
India -> Pune, Chennai, Kochi
US -> NJ, NY, Houston
UK -> London, Bristol, Hampshire
```

* Have two dropdown lists. 
* The first list will have the countries
* When you select a country the second dropdown list will get populated with the cities of that country.

### Stage 2
* Do it if you want to push yourself a bit more. :)

* Store the countries and cities collection in __HTML 5 localstorage__
* The usage is __localStorage.setItem("key",value)__
* If you refresh the browser it should try loading these values from Local Storage instead of recreating them
